Docker Images
=======================

## Following docker configs are based on Debian (jessie) images:

1) Dockerfile_postgres_9_6: Plese use this configuration for development purposes. Please refer to the [top level README](https://github.com/apache/madlib/blob/master/README.md) for setup instructions.

2) Dockerfile_postgres_11_Jenkins: This configuration is used by the Jenkins builds (https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Madlib/job/madlib-build/job/master and https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Madlib/job/madlib-build/view/change-requests/).

## The rest of the configs are based on CentOS images:

2) Dockerfile_centos_7_postgres_10 : Used for automated testing on centos 7 with postgres 10.
